It is fully featured, stable, mature and platform independent with an easy to use C/C++ API. It has advanced joint types and integrated collision detection with friction. ODE is useful for simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality environments and virtual creatures. It is currently used in many computer games, 3D authoring tools and simulation tools.

* **Pinocchio** by Carpentier et al. (2019). Pinocchio is an open-source library (C++ with Python bindings) for efficiently computing the dynamics (and derivatives) of a robot model, or of any articulated rigid-body model you would like (avatars in a simulator, skeletal models for biomechanics, etc.). Pinocchio is one of the most efficient libraries for computing the dynamics of articulated bodies and implements   algorithms following the methods described in Featherstone's 2008 [book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387743141). It also introduces efficient variations of some of them, plus some new ones, notably including a full set of algorithms to compute the derivatives of the main ones.
